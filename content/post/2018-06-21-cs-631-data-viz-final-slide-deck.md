For my CS 631 Data Visualization final brief that I presented in class, I explored using boxplot + facet wrapping to compare the increase in cFos activity following different behavioral measures faceted by different brain regions. 

Here are some my [slides](../../slides/xaringan.html) made with Xaringan.

Enjoy!
