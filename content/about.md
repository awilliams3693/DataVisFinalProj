_Amy Williams is a PhD candidate with a strong interest in data visualization, analysis, and licensing practices._

**Background**

  My background is in academia, specifically neuroscience and psychology research with a focus on mental health with abberant learning components.
  My undergraduate work at University of California, Santa Barbara in the lab of Karen Szumlinski, PhD focus on the neural molecular processes behind cocaine and alcohol learned binging behavior. From there, I joined the Department of Behavioral Neuroscience in 2013 to work with Matt Lattal, PhD in studying the neurobiology of abberant fear learning that mimics some symptomology of PTSD. 
  During my PhD, I discovered my love of data analysis and visualization. The moment of significant findings (or more often lack thereof) was my favorite and led to endless more questions. I am also passionate about the legality and intellectual property of how data is shared.
  Now, I am finishing up my dissertation and beginning to tackle more advanced data analysis and visualization projects that I will attempt to outline here.

In my spare time, I make art, fiddle around with arduinos/raspberry-pis, and listen to live music.
